## Overview
 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Have the hover effects with text for Work section page


## My process

- I took my time to understand the website layouts and aesthetic
- Took noticed of common element styles such as the button and colors
- Worked on each section of the page (HTML and Vanilla CSS)
- Make use of components such as color variables and common styles

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Vanilla CSS
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow (in progress)



### What I learned

Learnt about adding hover effects to a div section (see the work section for details)



### Continued development

I will still continue to work on the project mobile responsivness
